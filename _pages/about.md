## Bio

I am an undergraduate student at CSEE, Hunan University.

Before commencing my PhD, I completed [Part III](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/postgrad/part-iii/current) at [St John's College](https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge, where my focus was on Mathematical Statistics and optimization. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor degree in [Mathematics with Statistcis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ug/courses/mathematics-department/mathematics-with-statistics-bsc/) from Imperial College London in 2019.

I spent my summer in 2019 as a research student at the [Goldenberg Lab](http://goldenberglab.ca/) in Toronto, Canada. There, I worked on using NLP to help fascilitate early-stage diagnosis of Sepsis at [SickKids](https://www.sickkids.ca/). This project was supervised by Dr Anna Goldenberg and Erik Drysdale, and was funded by the [Fields Undergraduate Summer Research Program](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/2019-fusrp). A short summary of the project can be found on their website. 

Besides statistics, I spend most of my time hiking, playing the guitar, and volunteering. In February 2021, I joined [Bridges for Enterprise](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/) (BfE), a non-profit organisation, as a Global Analytics and Algorithm Manager. BfE is a global non-profit providing pro-bono advisory services to social enterprise startups in the developing world. My job at BfE is to oversee the Data Analytics and Machine Learning projects in its Tech division. Find out more about what they do and their volunteering opportunities on their [website](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/).
